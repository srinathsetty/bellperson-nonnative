# bellpepper-nonnative

This is a fork of [`bellman-bignat`](https://github.com/alex-ozdemir/bellman-bignat) library, with the following "small" modifications:

* Uses bellpepper, a fork of `bellperson`, which is itself a fork of `bellman`
* Trims the library to only provide big-number arithmetic functionality.

Test can be run using `cargo`.
